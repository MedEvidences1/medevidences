The AI engineer's work involved rebuilding MedEvidences.com, a Mercor.com clone for medical/scientific hiring, after a previous session ended due to credit exhaustion. The initial phase focused on setting up the basic full-stack (FastAPI, React, MongoDB) platform with core functionalities like user authentication, job posting, and application management. Challenges included recurrent frontend compilation errors due to escaped quotes in component files, which required rewriting. The project evolved through several user-driven iterations, adding detailed job postings, AI interview logic, job seeding, and comprehensive candidate/employer dashboards. Recent efforts expanded to Google OAuth, email notifications, a payment system (backend models, frontend checkout page), and an admin panel. The user expressed frustration over repeated issues and deployment delays. The current state involves an application deployed to a test URL, with the last task being a verification of advanced AI features and payroll management, with a clear instruction to implement if missing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's explicit request to verify the implementation of several advanced features. The user asked if the platform includes: auto resume screening, intelligent AI candidate matching, managing payroll and compliance for contractors, dynamic data collection for improved predictions, and automatic job listing retrieval from Mercor.com. If these features were not present, the user requested their implementation. The AI engineer has just initiated the process of checking the codebase ( after  command in message 480) to determine the current status of these complex functionalities. This task involves reviewing existing code to see if these components are already partially or fully built, or if they require new development.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue checking the codebase for the presence of auto resume screening, advanced AI matching, payroll/compliance management, dynamic data collection, and Mercor job retrieval, and then implement any identified missing features as requested by the user.
